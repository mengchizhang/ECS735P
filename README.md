# Ontology Modelling and Linking Information

This project aims to build our own ontology structure upon a certain concept, populated it with external real world semantic data repositories and query it using SPARQL, to practice the ontology modelling and semantic data manipulation skills.

Environments: 
OS X Yosemite 10.10.5 | Python 2.7.11 

Software and tools: 
Protégé 5.0.0 Beta 21 | Apache Jena Fuseki 2.3.1

Data Source: 
http://dbpedia.org/

Objectives
##1: Choose a concept and build an ontology using Protégé.
##2: Write queries to construct and populate an external semantic data source into the existing ontology.
##3: Use SPARQL to query the populated local ontology.
##4: Find another external semantic data repository, fuse it with existing data structure and make a query that cannot be answered by either remote knowledge base alone.
